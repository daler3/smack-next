Linux Security Module framework
-------------------------------

The Linux Security Module (LSM) framework provides a mechanism for
various security checks to be hooked by new kernel extensions. The name
"module" is a bit of a misnomer since these extensions are not actually
loadable kernel modules. Instead, they are selectable at build-time via
CONFIG_DEFAULT_SECURITY and can be overridden at boot-time via the
"security=..." kernel command line argument, in the case where multiple
LSMs were built into a given kernel.

The primary users of the LSM interface are Mandatory Access Control
(MAC) extensions which provide a comprehensive security policy. Examples
include SELinux, Smack, Tomoyo, and AppArmor. In addition to the larger
MAC extensions, other extensions can be built using the LSM to provide
specific changes to system operation when these tweaks are not available
in the core functionality of Linux itself.

The Linux capabilities modules will always be included. For more details
on capabilities, see capabilities(7) in the Linux man-pages project.
This may be followed by any number of "minor" modules and at most one
"major" module.

A list of the active security modules can be found by reading
/sys/kernel/security/lsm. This is a comma separated list, and
will always include the capability module. The list reflects the
order in which checks are made. The capability module will always
be first, followed by any "minor" modules (e.g. Yama) and then
the one "major" module (e.g. SELinux) if there is one configured.

Process attributes associated with "major" security modules should
be accessed and maintained using the special files in the module
specific subdirectories in /proc/.../attr. The attributes related
to Smack would be found in /proc/.../attr/smack while the attributes
for SELinux would be in /proc/.../attr/selinux. Using the files
found directly in /proc/.../attr (e.g. current) should be avoided.
These files remain as legacy interfaces.

The files named "context" in the attr directories contain the
same information as the "current" files, but formatted to
identify the module it comes from.

if selinux is the active security module:
	/proc/self/attr/context could contain selinux='unconfined_t'
	/proc/self/attr/selinux/context could contain selinux='unconfined_t'

Based on https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/26/215,
a new LSM is accepted into the kernel when its intent (a description of
what it tries to protect against and in what cases one would expect to
use it) has been appropriately documented in Documentation/security/.
This allows an LSM's code to be easily compared to its goals, and so
that end users and distros can make a more informed decision about which
LSMs suit their requirements.

see include/linux/lsm_hooks.h.
